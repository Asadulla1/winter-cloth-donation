        <span className="font-bold">Our Mission: At Cozy Care Initiative,</span>{" "}
        we believe that small acts of kindness can create big changes. Our
        mission is to provide a platform where people can easily donate their
        unused clothes, offering them a second life in the hands of those who
        need them most. Together, we can make a meaningful difference in the
        lives of families in rural and underprivileged areas, giving them
        warmth, dignity, and hope. How You Can Contribute: By donating your
        gently used clothes, you're not just clearing space in your
        wardrobe—you’re offering a chance for someone to live better. Every
        piece matters. It might seem small to you, but it can mean the world to
        someone else. Join us in spreading kindness, one donation at a time.
        Your generosity can change lives.
